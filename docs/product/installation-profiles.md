# Installation Profiles

The installers expose two product profiles and no arbitrary feature matrix.

## Core

Core is the default. Its exact files are declared in
`scripts/harness-install-files.txt`:

```text
AGENTS.md
docs/WORKFLOW.md
docs/README.md
docs/product/README.md
docs/plans/README.md
docs/plans/active/README.md
docs/plans/completed/README.md
docs/decisions/README.md
docs/templates/decision.md
docs/templates/exec-plan.md
```

The platform installer downloads a checksum-verified `harness` binary, places
it at `scripts/bin/harness` (or `.exe`), and delegates core installation to it.
The CLI records the exact upstream base in `.harness-core/`; future updates use
that base for a conflict-safe three-way merge and persistent backup.

Core performs no compatibility-CLI download, schema discovery, database
bootstrap installation, or database-specific `.gitignore` write. A core update
does not remove an existing `harness-cli` or database.

## Core Plus CLI

`--with-cli` in Bash or `-WithCli` in PowerShell adds the optional
compatibility manifest at
`scripts/harness-cli-install-files.txt`, every `scripts/schema/*.sql` migration,
generated database/binary ignore rules, and a checksum-verified platform
binary. `--upgrade-cli` / `-UpgradeCli` implies this profile.

The compatibility inputs and binary are staged before compatibility target
files change. A staging, download, checksum, or apply failure restores the
previous compatibility files. Core files already installed remain usable.

## Core Update Contract

`harness update --dry-run` resolves the published `harness-v*` core-release
pointer, downloads and checksum-verifies that exact release candidate, then
requires its reported version to match that release, then reports the
candidate's planned merge without writing. A
normal update takes upstream content when the consumer did not change a file,
keeps a consumer-only edit, and uses Git's three-way text merge when both sides
changed. A candidate older than either installed provenance or the executing
binary is rejected.

An overlapping edit stages an ignored resolution session under
`.harness-core/update/` with BASE, LOCAL, UPSTREAM, and agent-editable RESOLVED
copies plus a frozen copy of every other managed input. The remotely
re-verifiable candidate is retained under `.harness-core/update-candidate/`.
Managed workspace files, installed provenance, and the executable stay
unchanged. A normal `harness update` replaces a pending plan and jumps directly
from the installed version to the latest release; its dry-run previews that
new plan without removing the existing session. After human direction resolves
the semantic choice, `harness update --continue --dry-run` previews the accepted
result for the pinned candidate and `harness update --continue` applies it.
`harness update --abort` removes only the staged session. Continuation rejects
unresolved markers, malformed staged inputs, candidate tampering, and drift in
any managed workspace file.

A missing managed file, unsafe path, corrupt base, or other structural conflict
also stops the complete update but requires correcting the workspace and
starting again rather than editing a resolution packet. Successful updates
write provenance last, retain prior bytes under `.harness-backup/`, and replace
only the repository-local executing binary after the core-file transaction
succeeds. A retained candidate lets a later update repair rare core/executable
version skew. Repository executable and retained-candidate paths must contain
regular files and directories rather than symlinks.

The first release containing network discovery is a one-time bootstrap
boundary: older executables must be refreshed with the platform installer once.
After that transition, installed executables discover later core releases
themselves.

Installers also execute a candidate before replacing an existing binary. If the
candidate finds a conflict, resolve the staged file and rerun the installer; it
continues the exact pending version and replaces the binary only after success.

## Ownership

The installers do not copy this repository's root README, architecture, build
scripts, tests, CI, historical decisions, or provenance into a consumer. Those
paths describe upstream Harness or its evolution, not the consumer product.
